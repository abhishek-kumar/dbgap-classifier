75, framingham cohort important links and information instructions to request authorized access data use certification agreement apply for authorized access acknowledgement statements participant protection policy faq startup of framingham heart study cardiovascular disease cvd is the leading cause of death and serious illness in the united states in 1948 the framingham heart study fhs under the direction of the national heart institute now known as the national heart lung and blood institute nhlbi embarked on a novel and ambitious project in health research at the time little was known about the general causes of heart disease and stroke but the death rates for cvd had been increasing steadily since the beginning of the century and had become an american epidemic the objective of the fhs was to identify the common factors or characteristics that contribute to cvd by following its development over a long period of time in a large group of participants who had not yet developed overt symptoms of cvd or suffered a heart attack or stroke design of framingham heart study in 1948 the researchers recruited 5209 men and women between the ages of 30 and 62 from the town of framingham massachusetts and began the first round of extensive physical examinations and lifestyle interviews that they would later analyze for common patterns related to cvd development since 1948 the subjects have returned to the study every two years for an examination consisting of a detailed medical history physical examination and laboratory tests and in 1971 the study enrolled a secondgeneration cohort 5124 of the original participants39 adult children and their spouses to participate in similar examinations the second examination of the offspring cohort occurred eight years after the first examination and subsequent examinations have occurred approximately every four years thereafter in april 2002 the study entered a new phase the enrollment of a third generation of participants the grandchildren of the original cohort the first examination of the third generation study was completed in july 2005 and involved 4095 participants thus the fhs has evolved into a prospective communitybased three generation family study the fhs is a joint project of the national heart lung and blood institute and boston university research areas in the framingham heart study over the years careful monitoring of the fhs population has led to the identification of the major cvd risk factors high blood pressure high blood cholesterol smoking obesity diabetes and physical inactivity as well as a great deal of valuable information on the effects of related factors such as blood triglyceride and hdl cholesterol levels age gender and psychosocial issues risk factors have been identified for the major components of cvd including coronary heart disease stroke intermittent claudication and heart failure it is also clear from research in the fhs and other studies that substantial subclinical vascular disease occurs in the blood vessels heart and brain that precedes clinical cvd with recent advances in technology the fhs has enhanced its research capabilities and capitalized on its inherent resources by the conduct of high resolution imaging to detect and quantify subclinical vascular disease in the major blood vessels heart and brain these studies have included ultrasound studies of the heart echocardiography and carotid arteries computed tomography studies of the heart and aorta and magnetic resonance imaging studies of the brain heart and aorta although the framingham cohort is primarily white the importance of the major cvd risk factors identified in this group have been shown in other studies to apply almost universally among racial and ethnic groups even though the patterns of distribution may vary from group to group in the past half century the study has produced approximately 1200 articles in leading medical journals the concept of cvd risk factors has become an integral part of the modern medical curriculum and has led to the development of effective treatment and preventive strategies in clinical practice in addition to research studies focused on risk factors subclinical cvd and clinically apparent cvd framingham investigators have also collaborated with leading researchers from around the country and throughout the world on projects involving some of the major chronic illnesses in men and women including dementia osteoporosis and arthritis nutritional deficiencies eye diseases hearing disorders and chronic obstructive lung diseases genetic research in the framingham heart study while pursuing the study39s established research goals the nhlbi and the framingham investigators has expanded its research mission into the study of genetic factors underlying cvd and other disorders over the past two decades dna has been collected from blood samples and from immortalized cell lines obtained from original cohort participants members of the offspring cohort and the third generation cohort several largescale genotyping projects have been conducted in the past decade genomewide linkage analysis has been conducted using genotypes of approximately 400 microsatellite markers that have been completed in over 9300 subjects in all three generations analyses using microsatellite markers completed in the original cohort and offspring cohorts have resulted in over 100 publications including many publications from the genetics analysis workshop 13 several other recent collaborative projects have completed thousands of snp genotypes for candidate gene regions in subsets of fhs subjects with available dna these projects include the cardiogenomics program of the nhlbi39s programs for genomics

is part of the gene environment association studies initiative geneva funded by the national human genome research institute the overarching goal is to identify novel genetic factors that contribute to addiction through a largescale genomewide association study of dsmiv alcohol dependent and frequently illicit drug dependent cases and nondependent unrelated control subjects of european and african american descent the focus of this proposal is a casecontrol design of unrelated individuals for a genetic association study of addiction cases are defined as individuals with dsmiv alcohol dependence lifetime and potentially other illicit drug dependence in addition to the categorical diagnosis we have data on ordinal measurements of number of dsmiv symptoms for alcohol nicotine marijuana cocaine opiates and other drugs so that we will able to construct quantitative measurements of addiction severity over a wide range of substances controls are defined as individuals who have been exposed to alcohol and possibly to other drugs but have never met lifetime diagnosis for alcohol dependence or dependence on other illicit substances analyses that include refinement of the phenotype and incorporation of important demographic and environmental factors into association studies will be pursued cases and controls were selected from three large complementary datasets the collaborative study on the genetics of alcoholism coga the family study of cocaine dependence fscd and the collaborative genetic study of nicotine dependence cogend coga coga was initiated in 1989 and is a largescale family study that has had as its primary aim the identification of genes that contribute to alcoholism susceptibility and related characteristics coga is funded through the national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism niaaa subjects were recruited from 7 sites across the us alcohol dependent probands were recruited from treatment facilities and assessed by personal interview after securing permission other family members were also assessed a set of comparison families was drawn from the same communities as the families recruited through the alcohol dependent probands assessment involved a comprehensive personal interview developed for this project the semistructured assessment for the genetics of alcoholism ssaga which gathers detailed information on alcoholism related symptoms along with other drugs and psychiatric symptoms families with three or more firstdegree relatives who were alcohol dependent were invited for more extensive testing including neurophysiology evaluations erps and eegs and a battery of neuropsychological assessments blood was obtained for genetic studies institutional review boards at all sites approved the

apply here for controlled access to individual level data research use statement questions regarding gaw16 should be directed to vanessa olmo at vanessabusinessendeavorscom problem 2 description of the framingham heart study in gaw16 we use data drawn from the framingham heart study the framingham heart study 8212 under the direction of national heart lung and blood institute nhlbi 8212 began in 1948 with the recruitment of adults from the town of framingham massachusetts at the time little was known about the general causes of heart disease and stroke but the death rates for cardiovascular disease cvd had been increasing steadily since the beginning of the 20th century and had become an american epidemic the framingham heart study is now conducted in collaboration with boston university the objective of the framingham heart study was to identify the common factors or characteristics that contribute to cvd by following its development over a long period of time in a large group of participants who had not yet developed overt symptoms of cvd or suffered a heart attack or stroke between 1948 and 1953 the researchers recruited 5209 subjects 2336 men and 2873 women between the ages of 29 and 62 from the town of framingham massachusetts and began the first round of extensive physical examinations and lifestyle interviews that they would later analyze for common patterns related to cvd development subjects were recruited from lists of addresses recorded for the town two out of every three households were approached for participation in the study while there was no intention to recruit families for family studies the plan was to recruit all household members in the ages 3060 within each house that was selected for study hence many biologically related individuals were recruited including 1644 spouse pairs since 1948 these participants have returned to the study every two years for a detailed medical history physical examination and laboratory tests now in 2008 at 60 years of follow up there remain about 500 participants from this cohort between 1971 and 1975 the study enrolled a secondgeneration group 8212 5124 of the original participants39 children and the spouses of these children 8212 to participate in similar examinations 2616 subjects are offspring of the original spouse pairs and 34 are stepchildren a total of 898 offspring are children of cohort members where only one parent was a study participant and 1576 are spouses of the offspring the offspring cohort has been followed every four years through 2001 except between exams 1 and 2 with an intervening 8 years using protocols similar to those used for study of the original cohort between 2002 and 2005 the study enrolled the third generation gen3 of the framingham heart study 4095 offspring of the second generation none of their spouses were recruited an additional 103 parents of this third generation who were not recruited between 1971 and 1975 were also recruited at this time the latter group is not included in the gaw16 data with the recruitment of this third generation the study has increasingly focused on genetic factors associated with the development of cardiovascular disease and its associated risk factors to date there is only one examination of this generation of participants a description of the recruitment of this third generation and comparison with the earlier generations at their initial recruitment is presented in splansky gl et al 2007 further information on the study can be found at httpwwwnhlbinihgovaboutframinghamindexhtml genomewide dense snp scan in framingham heart study genetic studies did not begin in the fhs until the 1990s in the late 1980s and through the 1990s dna was extracted from blood samples of surviving fhs participants in 2007 the fhs entered a new phase with the conduct of genotyping for the fhs share snp health association resource project for which dense snp genotyping was performed using approximately 550000 snps genechip174 human mapping 500k array set and the 50k human gene focused panel in 10775 samples some duplicates from the three generations of subjects including over 900 pedigrees affymetrix conducted all genotyping for the fhs share project using the 250k sty 250k nsp and the supplemental 50k platforms eightynine percent of the dna samples were collected during the 1990s to maximize the power of the study we also extracted dna from 1133 blood samples drawn from subjects who had no dna to include in the share project these samples had been sitting in our refrigerators for some time a few as far back as the 1970s we refer to these dna samples as the legacy samples these samples had a higher failure rate in the genotyping process 40 than the other eightynine percent 3 affymetrix invoked its own criteria for a sample to succeed in genotyping all nonlegacy samples must succeed on all three platforms while legacy samples needed to pass on at least one platform when a sample failed additional attempts were made samples that repeatedly failed 24 times were called failures other samples failed due to issues of genotyped sex identification not matching our records or low snp concordance among snps common across arrays or contamination eightynine percent of the legacy samples for which genotyping results are available passed all three platforms the genotyping data from the 10043 samples from 9354 subjects that passed the affymetrix criteria were additionally checked for gender consistency and consistency with family structure resulting in genotyping data for 9274 participants in fhs share genotype calls were made with the brlmm algorithm the share database is housed at the national center for biotechnology information database of genotypes and phenotypes ncbi dbgap and contains all 550000 snps this genomewide dense snp scan and a subset of phenotypes from the framingham heart study are the focus of the genetic analysis workshop 16 further information on

access background information primary openangle glaucoma poag is an agerelated intraocular pressure iopdependent progressive optic neuropathy that ultimately leads to irreversible blindness vision loss from poag is a condition of public health significance current evidence suggests that poag is a polygenetic disease modified by environmental influences despite the fact that a positive family history of disease is an important risk factor for poag conventional linkage and candidate gene approaches have revealed less than 5 of the genetic component of the disease furthermore there is no consensus on environment risk factors for poag elevated iop is the only modifiable risk factor for poag yet lowering iop slows but does not halt the disease process study objectives the overall goal of our research is to elucidate the pathogenesis of poag so that costeffective disease detection and primary prevention strategies can be implemented the primary aim of the glau coma g ene en vironment initiative glaugen funded by the human genome research institute nhgri is to discover genetic loci associated with poag the secondary aim of glaugen funded by nhgri and the national eye institute is to discover gene environment interactions in poag methods and study populations for this study we have assembled cases and controls from three studies the nurses39 health study nhs the

controls members of the nhs and hpfs also have repeated environmental exposure data collected prior to a diagnosis of poag nhs the nurses health study started in 1976 under the direction of dr frank e speizer with funding from the nih registered nurses from 11 us states were invited to complete a detailed questionnaire regarding lifestyle and health biennially initially 121000 women responded to the baseline questionnaire currently dr susan hankinson serves as the program director for the nhs hpfs the health professionals followup study began in 1986 under the direction of drs walter willett and meir stampfer under the auspices of the nih they enlisted 51529 male health professionals from throughout the us to complete similarly designed biennial questionnaires beginning in 1990 questions regarding ocular health were added to biennial questionaires completed by health professionals participating in the nhs and hpfs this allowed us to formulate pi s hankinson nei and maintain pi l pasquale nei a cohort at risk for poag derived from the respective general cohorts who were under ophthalmic care we then developed a definition of poag that allowed us to identify cases from a population that was geographically dispersed the centerpiece of this definition is the presence of reproducible visual field loss consistent with nerve fiber layer nfl dropout the nfl contains the axons that comprise the optic nerve on reliable tests reproducible visual field loss occurred in the context of anterior segment findings that did not suggest a secondary cause of elevated iop and posterior segment findings that did not suggest a secondary cause of visual field loss we selected controls from the cohort at risk for poag on the basis of age gender and time period when cases were identified gep the genetic etiologies of poag was initiated in 1996 with funding from the national eye institute under the direction of dr janey wiggs the purpose of this work was to discover novel genetic loci associated with poag in the gep cases were derived predominantly from the glaucoma service at meei the majority of cases had an examination by a glaucoma specialist and met the definition for poag used in nhs and hpfs cases with only one reliable visual field consistent with nfl dropout were included if there was a cupdisc ratio of 07 or more the majority of controls were patients who presented to the meei comprehensive ophthalmology service for routine eye examination or from spouses of meei patients with secondary forms of glaucoma other controls were identified from regional

dbgap study accession phs000092 the majority of these subjects are independent from the current study but there is a small amount of overlap between the two samples n29 subjects for quality control purposes it should be noted that the case definition in the sage study is dsmiv alcohol dependence the case definition in the current study is nicotine dependence by a current score of 4 or greater on the fagerstr246m test for nicotine dependence ftnd the overall goal of this project is to identify and characterize genetic variants that contribute to the development of nicotine dependence related smoking behaviors and smoking cessation the cogend sample includes unrelated cases and controls for a genetic association study of nicotine dependence cases are defined by a commonly used definition of nicotine dependence a current score of 4 or more maximum score of 10 on the fagerstr246m test for nicotine dependence ftnd control status is defined as an individual who smoked at least 100 cigarettes during their lifetime yet never became dependent lifetime ftnd0 by selecting controls who smoked those genetic effects that are specific to nicotine dependence can be examined the uwtturc sample includes nicotine dependent smokers from three smoking cessation studies subjects had to smoke at least 10 cigarettes per day confirmed smoking by an alveolar carbon monoxide co level greater

phs000095 dental caries whole genome association and gene x environment studies and dbgap accession number phs000094 international consortium to identify genes and interactions controlling oral clefts the goal of this study is to investigate genetic determinants to dental caries and to ofcs in a novel study population to date most genetic studies of dental caries have been conducted in caucasians and of ofcs in caucasians and asians the guatemalan population under study is rural and ethnically mixed with a high proportion of nativesouthamericans thirtysix guatemalans from this dataset were also part of the recent gwas studies of cleft lip and cleft palate beaty et al 2010 and 2011 dbgap study accession phs000094 international consortium to identify genes and interactions controlling oral clefts in addition to the families ascertained in guatemala some subjects were genotyped with this cohort to augment the data in the parent geneva study dental caries whole genome association and gene x environment studies dbgap accession number phs000095 in particular individuals from the iowa and pitt geneva study sites their data are available with the parent study dental caries also known as tooth decay remains the most common chronic disease of childhood five times more common than asthma and seven times more common than environmental allergies with more than 40 of children exhibiting caries when they enter kindergarten in 2005 it was estimated that dental health care costs were approximately 84 billion of which 60 or about 50 billion were related to treatment of dental caries the etiology of dental caries has been studied for many years multiple factors contribute to a person39s risk for caries including 1 environmental factors such as diet oral hygiene fluoride exposure and the level of colonization of cariogenic bacteria and 2 host factors such as salivary flow salivary buffering capacity position of teeth relative to each other surface characteristics of tooth enamel and depth of occlusal fissures on posterior teeth in spite of all that is known about this disease there are still individuals who appear to be more susceptible to caries and those who are extremely resistant regardless of the environmental risk factors to which they are exposed implying that genetic factors also play an important role in caries etiology this conclusion is supported by studies in both humans and animals with the most compelling evidence coming from studies of twins reared apart in which investigators found significant resemblance within monozygotic mz but not dizygotic dz twin pairs for percentage of teeth and surfaces restored or carious and estimated the genetic contribution to caries as 40 other recent studies of twins reared together estimated the heritability for caries adjusted for age and gender as ranging from 4564 in our study populations of families we also estimated caries heritability as approximately 5470 of variation in primary dentition caries scores and 3555 in the permanent dentition wang et al 2010 orofacial clefts ofcs particularly cleft lip with or without cleft palate clp and isolated cleft palate cp are a major public health problem affecting one in every 5001000 births worldwide thus representing the most common facial birth defect and one of the most common of all congenital anomalies clp is a major structural birth defect that is notable for significant lifelong morbidity and complex etiology the extensive psychological surgical speech and dental involvement emphasize the importance of understanding the underlying causes of clp therefore many research groups have attempted to elucidate the etiology of clp with some recent success by our research group and others see beaty et al 2010 2011 dixon et al 2011 it is clear that clp can occur as part of mendelian syndromes that certain chromosomal abnormalities include clp in the phenotype and that certain teratogens can increase the risk of having an offspring with clp however phenotypes of known etiology comprise only a small portion of all individuals with a clp or cp and the major focus of research into ofcs is to develop an understanding of the etiology of nonsyndromic ns forms of clefting a major focus of the university of pittsburgh ccdg has been to study additional phenotypes within nonsyndromic ofc families in order to identify subclinical expressions of ofc risk genes or risk variants eg snps see weinberg et al 2006 a detailed oral exam is conducted as part of these extended phenotypic studies including a dental caries exam note that although there are some reports in the literature of higher caries experience in individuals with clefts the most recent metaanalysis of those literature reports concluded that individuals born with these defects do not have a higher frequency of caries hassl246f and twetman 2007 notably we investigated the association of clp and caries in three of our study populations including part of the guatemalan population in this gwas study and also found no increase in caries rates of clp cases versus controls jindal et al 2011 this study is part of the gene environment association studies
